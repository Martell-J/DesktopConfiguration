'   Description:    Provides a solution to Window's unintuitive methods of selecting desktop backgrounds,
'                   as this program allows you to specifically set wallpapers to specific monitors (without
'                   the need to create a folder features a range of images, and hope windows' slideshow selects
'                   the correct one.

'                   This project mainly serves as a means to demonstrate my knowledge in creating
'                   basic--yet functional--windows form applications utilizing VB.net.
